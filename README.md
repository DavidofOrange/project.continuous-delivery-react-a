//We may need to give some code examples here **\***
Code Example:
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation:
Packages needed are in JSON.package.
Postgres needs to be pre-installed and a database named 'truckstop' should be created.

//We need to make an API Reference **\***
API Reference:
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
